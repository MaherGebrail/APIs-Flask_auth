there is a sample of api request in simple_projects_savestime

Note:***  this project just to show the auth for users , while if you are a little paranoid , you can save the hashing of all passwords and the full object to another server holding only the object , connecting to the flask app , to prevent the backends developer to see the object .. while actually hashing names and passes will not make you in a need for that , but just to keep the object safe in a case of incident happens to the server (as a backup).
